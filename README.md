# Cigna-Offers-Analysis-Report
Analysis report for offers given by Cigna Dental.

Converted PDF files to excel format using data retrieval tool in Microsoft Excel.
Data cleaning and transformation to proper 3 column style (Procedure code, description, and fees). 

Used [Procedres-by-Procedure-Codes](https://github.com/and33zy/Procedures-by-Procedure-Code/blob/main/Procedures%20By%20Procedure%20Code.csv) as current Cigna fees to compare with 1rst, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (final) offers. 

Also included Careington's platinum fee schedule as they can possibly pickup Cigna as a third party carrier and pay by the platinum fee schedule. 

Connection Dental recently (July 2023) announced partnership with Cigna dental, can possibly become another 3rd party carrier other than Careington.
