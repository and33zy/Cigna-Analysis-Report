# Cigna-Offers-Analysis-Report
Analysis report for offers given by Cigna Dental.

Used [Procedres-by-Procedure-Codes](https://github.com/and33zy/Procedures-by-Procedure-Code/blob/main/Procedures%20By%20Procedure%20Code.csv) to compare current, 1rst offer, and 2nd offer rates provided by Cigna Dental. 

This report includes the first offer analysis report. First analysis not shown due to second offer being given almost same day. 

Analysis report compares current Cigna rates with first offer, second offer, and also rates by Careington's fee schedule. 

This report includes Careington because a third party carrier such as Careington can pay the office through their rates due to Cigna's partnership with Careington.
